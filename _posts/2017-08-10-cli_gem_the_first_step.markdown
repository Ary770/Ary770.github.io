Developing an interactive CLI script from scratch is not an easy task. Especially if it's your first time developing a full application. 

To be quite honest, this part of the curriculum appeared to me like a huge unclimbable mountain. At first, I had all these thoughts running through my head, 'where do I even start?' , 'I've never created a full project from scratch!', 'I can't even reach out to Lean experts,' 'AAAA!!', etc. You know what I mean right?

Even though it was indeed a more challenging task, I tried to take a deep breath and thought to myself; 'this is not the first time in my learning how to code journey that I've felt like this. These type of thoughts and feelings are not new. And yet, I made it all the way here...I can do this. I'm not sure how yet, but I can do this'. 

After that, somehow, everything just started flowing. And it begins by taking little steps. Think to yourself; 'what is the next step?'. Just the next step. Not 'how am I going to develop this huge app on my own.' 

Looking back now after finishing the [App](http://https://github.com/Ary770/herbal-remedies-cli-app) (which I think came out pretty good :) ), I realized that the hardest part of the whole process was getting over my insecurity and negative mindset. 

So if you ever feel stuck or overwhelmed in the face of a challenge. Take a deep breath (or a few!) and realize you've come a long way. Trust yourself.
