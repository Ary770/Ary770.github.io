Developing a CLI Gem from scratch is not an easy task.
To be quite honest, this part of the curriculum appeared to me like a huge unclimbable mountain. At first, I had all these thoughts running through my head, 'where do I even start?' , 'I've never created a full project from scratch!', 'I can't even reach out to Lean experts,' 'AAAA!!', etc. You know what I mean right?

Even though it was truly a more challenging lab, I tried to take a deep breath and thought to myself; 'this is not the first time in the curriculum I've felt like this. These type of thoughts and feelings are not new. And yet, somehow, I made it all the way here... I can do this. I'm not sure how yet, but I can do this'. 

After that, somehow, everything just started flowing. And it begins by taking little steps. Think to yourself; 'what is the next step?'. Just the next step. Not 'how am I going to develop this huge app on my own.' 

Looking back now after finishing the Gem (which I think came out pretty good :) ), I realized that the hardest part of the whole process was getting over my insecurity and negative mindset. 

So if you ever feel stuck or overwhelmed in the face of a challenge. Take a deep breath (or a few!). Realize, you've come a long way. Trust yourself. And trust the Program.
